# Friends Book

Friends Book is a C++ project that mimics basic functionalities of a social networking platform similar to Facebook. The program allows users to be added, edited, or deleted from a network, using data structures that efficiently manage user information.

## Features

- **Add User**: Create a new user profile with relevant details.
- **Edit User**: Update the details of an existing user.
- **Delete User**: Remove a user from the system.
- **Search User**: Find a user by name or other criteria.

## Data Structures Used

The project uses various C++ data structures to handle user information:
- **Linked Lists**: To maintain and manage the list of users.
- **Hash Maps**: For fast lookup and retrieval of user data.
- **Dynamic Arrays**: To store user attributes and connections.
- **Trees (Optional)**: For organizing user connections, if necessary.

## Technologies

- **C++ Standard Library**: Utilizes standard data structures and algorithms.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Users are represented as objects, with methods for modifying and accessing their data.
